# 🛡️ OWASP365 Mapping - Practical Use Cases for Microsoft 365 Security

A curated set of realistic, recruiter-oriented examples mapping the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) risks to Microsoft 365 services.  
Each use case includes a scenario, impacted components, potential impact, mitigation strategies, and links to official Microsoft documentation.

📁 Folder: `Use_Case_Examples/`  
📌 Mapping: `OWASP_M365_Mapping.md`  
🛡️ Mitigations: `Mitigation_Strategies.md`

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This project is designed to:

- Help junior cybersecurity candidates demonstrate practical threat modeling skills
- Bridge the gap between OWASP theory and Microsoft 365 practice
- Showcase awareness of evolving risks, including AI-related threats and low-code integrations

---

## 📦 Structure

Each use case follows a consistent format:

- **Scenario** - realistic, role-based context
- **OWASP Risk** - mapped to OWASP Top 10 (2021)
- **Microsoft 365 Component** - platform, feature, and documentation link
- **Potential Impact** - business and technical consequences
- **Mitigation Strategies** - actionable steps with Microsoft tooling
- **Search Tips** - curated queries for official documentation
- **Related Files** - cross-references to mapping and strategy docs

---

## 🚀 How to Use

Browse the `Use_Case_Examples/` folder to explore individual OWASP risks mapped to Microsoft 365 scenarios.  
Each file name follows the convention: `A##_<Platform>_<ShortDescriptor>.md`, where:

- `A##` refers to the OWASP Top 10 identifier (e.g. A01, A02, … A10)
- `<Platform>` indicates the Microsoft 365 service involved (e.g. Outlook, Teams, Entra ID, PowerPlatform)
- `<ShortDescriptor>` summarises the risk scenario (e.g. WeakAuth, AutoForwarding, SSRFConnector)

All files are standalone, recruiter-readable, and structured for clarity.  
Start with `OWASP_M365_Mapping.md` for a full overview of risks and platform associations.

## 🧠 Author Notes

This project was created as part of a cybersecurity learning journey focused on:

- Threat modeling in Microsoft 365
- Strategic documentation for junior job applications
- OWASP Top 10 alignment with real-world SaaS platforms

All examples are written in English and designed to be recruiter-readable, technically precise, and expandable.

## 🎨 Cover Credits

The OWASP365 Mapping cover image was generated using **OpenAI's DALL·E 3 model**.

**Prompt used:**

> "Professional minimalist cover design for a cybersecurity documentation project titled ‘OWASP 365 Mapping’. Depict a digital map or abstract network connecting Microsoft 365 services (Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, Power Platform) with security nodes symbolising OWASP Top 10 risks. Use a clean blue–grey and white Microsoft colour palette, with subtle geometric lines and modern typography. The design should look like a polished tech whitepaper or GitHub project cover."
